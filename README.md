# Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `static/js`: Folder containing the static resources for the webpage. 
    - `.gitkeep`: File kept from resource download. 
    - `app.js`: File cotaining JavaScript code for chart build and function.
- `index.html`: File containing html code for deploying the webpage.
- `samples.json`: File containing the data for analysis.
